              I first got into karate when I was in grade 4. It wasn't something I thought about at first, but my father encouraged me to give it a try.
              He knew I dreamed of becoming a police officer one day and believed that learning self-defense and discipline early on would help me in the future.
              At first, I was just curious, but over time, I began to enjoy the training, the challenge, and the structure it brought into my life.
              That's when I realized sports weren't just activities, they were tools to build character, strength, and focus.
              Since then, karate has become more than just a skill. It's a part of who I am.

            <p>
              My journey in Wushu Taolu began during my first year at the University of the Cordilleras. 
              It started with a simple invitation from a close friend during the school's sports recruitment.
              She didn't want to go alone and mentioned that there was a chance of earning a full scholarship if we joined.
              I was curious, so I talked it over with my parents, and they gave me the go-ahead to attend the training.
              On the day of practice, I showed up expecting her to be there, but she wasn't. When I messaged her, she said she decided 
              to back out because she couldn't manage both academics and training. I was a bit disappointed, but I chose to stay.
              As the sessions went on, I began to realize that Wushu Taolu wasn't just something new, it felt familiar.
              Its movements reminded me of karate, which made it easier to connect with.
              Eventually, I started joining parades, performances, and competitions. What began as a favor to a friend turned into something 
              I truly enjoyed and found potential in. It challenged me, shaped me, and became another part of my growing journey in sports.
